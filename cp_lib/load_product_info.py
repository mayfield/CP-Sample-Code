    You have 3 ways to do this. (code does not validate the contents)

    1) if there is a [product_info] section in ./config/settings.ini, then
       this is used and no access to the router is attempted. However,
       this blocks use of the status/product_info/manufacturing data - it
       WILL not be included as of Mar-2016, we don't support sub-sections.

    2) else, if there is a file named ./config/product_info.json (all
       lower case), then this is opened and loaded, merged into settings.

    3) else, if section [router_api] is correct, then REQUESTS is used
       to fetch the actual value, which is merged into
       settings, accessed as self.settings["product_info"].
